# cafeFactorSHARK
A plug-in to add weights to cause-fix relationships between artifact states based on labels.

## Requirements

cafeFactorSHARK currently relies on the data provided by cafeGraphSHARK, as well as data provided by vcsSHARK and, optionally, labelSHARK. Additionally, it depends on commonSHARK (https://github.com/smartshark/commonSHARK) which provides required libraries as well as common funtionalities.
